# 0x10. Python - Network #0

This project is part of the DevOps and SysAdmin track at Holberton School. It is designed to help students understand the concepts of networking, scripting, back-end development, and APIs.

## Tasks

### Task 0: cURL body size

In this task, we write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response. The size is displayed in bytes. We use `curl` for this task.

You can find the script for this task [here](https://github.com/alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0/blob/main/0-body_size.sh).

### Task 1: cURL to the end

In this task, we write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a `GET` request to the URL, and displays the body of the response. We display only the body of a `200` status code response. We use `curl` for this task.

You can find the script for this task [here](https://github.com/alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0/blob/main/1-body.sh).

### Task 2: cURL Method

In this task, we write a Bash script that sends a `DELETE` request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response. We use `curl` for this task.

You can find the script for this task [here](https://github.com/alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0/blob/main/2-delete.sh).

### Task 3: cURL only methods

In this task, we write a Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept. We use `curl` for this task.

You can find the script for this task [here](https://github.com/alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0/blob/main/3-methods.sh).

### Task 4: cURL headers

In this task, we write a Bash script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a `GET` request to the URL, and displays the body of the response. A header variable `X-School-User-Id` must be sent with the value `98`. We use `curl` for this task.

You can find the script for this task [here](https://github.com/alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0/blob/main/4-header.sh).

### Task 5: cURL POST parameters

In this task, we write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a `POST` request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response. A variable `email` must be sent with the value `test@gmail.com`. A variable `subject` must be sent with the value `I will always be here for PLD`. We use `curl` for this task.

You can find the script for this task [here](https://github.com/alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0/blob/main/5-post_params.sh).

### Task 6: Find a peak

This is a technical interview preparation task. You are not allowed to google anything. You have to solve it in a whiteboard first.
